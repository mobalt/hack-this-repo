This can be a challenge and takes years to get funds to be able to match one vehicle in that county. OATS has found over the years ways to put aside funds to help in this capital requirement such as donations contributions, depreciation costs on contracts and state-incentive programs such as the Neighborhood Assistance Program. We have fleet plans so replacements, expansions and major repairs are laid out for the future years to keep this service going.Our long-term goal is to provide the most transportation service for the dollars received and look for other means of support to continue our mission.

THE SCHOOL SUPPORT INCLUDES TEACHER SALARIES, SUPPLIES, MAINTENANCE, AND SCHOLARSHIPS FOR TEACHERS TO OBTAIN TEACHING DIPLOMAS AT THE CLOSEST UNIVERSITY AND SCHOLARSHIPS FOR THE 7TH GRADE GRADUATES TO CONTINUE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

       "   'LOST & FOUND GRIEF CENTER PROVIDES GRIEF SUPPORT SERVICES IN A SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT, AT NO CHARGE, FOR CHILDREN, YOUNG ADULTS, AND THEIR FAMILIES GRIEVING THE DEATH OF A LOVED ONE. THERAPEUTIC PEER SUPPORT GROUPS ARE OFFERED FOR CHILDREN PRE-SCHOOL AGE THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL WHO ARE GRIEVING THE DEATH OF A PARENT, SIBLING, OR PRIMARY CAREGIVER. WHILE THE YOUTH MEET WITH THEIR PEERS, PARENT/ADULT GROUPS MEET AT THE SAME TIME, ADDRESSING THE ENTIRE FAMILY DYNAMIC. LOST & FOUND GRIEF CENTER HAS BEEN THE ONLY PROVIDER OF FREE GRIEF SUPPORT TO CHILDREN IN SOUTHWEST MISSOURI FOR 13 YEARS. IN THAT TIME, THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN AND PARENTS HAVE RECEIVED SERVICES. THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR GRIEVING CHILDREN REPORTED IN 2011, 1 IN 9 CHILDREN WILL EXPERIENCE THE DEATH OF A PARENT BEFORE REACHING THE AGE OF 18. LOST & FOUND CONTINUES TO AVERAGE 235-255 CHILDREN AND ADULTS ATTENDING ONE OF NINETEEN GRIEF SUPPORT GROUPS TWO TIMES A MONTH. LOST & FOUND OPERATES UNDER THE PRINCIPLES THAT GRIEF I',\n",
       "   'THE PURPOSE AND GOAL OF THE SUPPORT GROUPS ARE TO ASSIST PARTICIPANTS IN IDENTIFYING AND EXPRESSING FEELINGS, PROVIDE EDUCATION AND EXPLORATION OF THE GRIEF PROCESS, ASSIST PARTICIPANTS TO FULLY WORK THROUGH THE GRIEVING PROCESS AND RE-INVEST IN LIFE WITH A FOCUS ON THE FUTURE, ASSIST FAMILIES IN DEVELOPING RITUALS TO COMMEMORATE THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE IN HEALTHY WAYS AND FACILITATE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN IN GROUPS. THROUGH ACTIVITIES IN THE GROUPS, CHILDREN LEARN WORDS TO HELP THEM EXPRESS THE FEELINGS THEY HAVE, HELPING THEM TO WORK THROUGH THE GRIEF RATHER THAN INTERNALIZING IT, WHICH CAN CREATE HEALTH PROBLEMS, DIFFICULTIES IN SCHOOL OR COMPLICATIONS LATER IN LIFE.'],\n",

The goal of the organization is to improve attendance at school, attitudes about school, social and educational development and most importantly self-esteem and motivation. Mentor St Louis is built on a collaboration between the St. Louis public schools and over 40 community and religious organizations, corporations and businesses to begin reaching children at the first grade level. It is the members of these organizations who volunteer as mentors to the students. During 2015 this program was expanded to cover students in selected schools in St. Louis County, Missouri.'],\n",
